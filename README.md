# ðŸ†— OK.css

**OK.css** is a
[class-less CSS framework](https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/) that adds sensible defaults to your web page. Adding it into your HTML will make your page look decent â€” no need to reference documentation or account for browser differences as long as your markup is semantically-correct.

To use it, you can [download](https://okcss.netlify.app/ok.min.css) or add the following line to your HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://okcss.netlify.app/ok.min.css" />
```

**OK.css** is somewhere between a CSS normalizer and a full-fledged framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)</a> or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)</a>. It's great for blogs or small single-page applications, but might not be so great for large, interactive apps that require JavaScript or custom elements.

## Development

Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

You can start a local server with `yarn start`. By default the page will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

Make updates to the CSS file in `./src/ok.css` and `yarn build` to create a minified version available in `./dist/ok.min.css`.
